# Reminders/Motivation

# Why
*Why am I undertaking this project?*

* **Purpose:** To demonstrate and enhance my skills in data analytics, machine learning, and data engineering while providing actionable insights for the hotel industry.

* **Belief:** I believe that data-driven decision-making can significantly improve operational efficiency and customer satisfaction in the hospitality industry.

* **Inspiration:** I am inspired by the potential to turn raw data into valuable insights that can drive strategic decisions and improve business outcomes.

# What
*What am I going to do?*

* **Data Conversion:** Convert open-source hotel reservation data into a structured database.
* **ETL/EDA/Feature Engineering:** Perform Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes; Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA); and feature engineering to prepare the data for analysis.
* **ML Modeling:** Build machine learning models for:
    * *Regressing Average Daily Rate (ADR):* Predicting the ADR based on various factors.
    * *Classifying Cancellations:* Determining the likelihood of a reservation being canceled.
    * *Forecasting Future ADR/Cancellations:* Predicting future ADR and cancellation rates to help in strategic planning.
* **Results Summarization:** Present the findings in a clear and concise manner for a non-technical audience, emphasizing the practical implications of the results.

# How
*How will I achieve these goals?*

## Data Acquisition and Preparation:
* **Acquire Data:** Obtain open-source hotel reservation data.
* **Database Creation:** Use the DuckDB pacakge to create a relational database.
* **ETL Processes:** Implement ETL pipelines using Python and/or SQL to clean and transform the data.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering:
* **EDA:** Use visualization and statistical methods to explore data patterns and relationships.
* **Feature Engineering:** Create new features and select important ones to improve model performance.

## Machine Learning Modeling:
* **ADR Regression Model:** Use regression techniques (e.g., linear regression, random forest) to predict ADR.
* **Cancellation Classification Model:** Apply classification algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees) to predict cancellations.
* **Forecasting Models:** Utilize time series forecasting methods (e.g., ARIMA, VARMA) for future ADR and cancellation predictions.

## Communication of Results:
* **Visualization:** Use tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly to create visualizations.
* **Reporting:** Create reports and presentations summarizing the findings and their implications in a way that is accessible to non-technical stakeholders.
