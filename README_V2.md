## Business Understanding

### Objective

- Understand the factors leading to reservation cancellations and variations in ADR.
- Develop predictive models to forecast cancellations and ADR.

### Business Goals

- **Improve Resource Allocation and Inventory Management:** By predicting cancellations, the hotel can better manage room availability, reducing the chance of overbooking and improving the overall guest experience.
- **Enhance Customer Satisfaction:** Anticipating cancellations allows the hotel to implement proactive measures, such as personalized offers or reminders, to reduce cancellation rates.
- **Optimize Pricing Strategies:** Accurate ADR forecasting helps in dynamic pricing, ensuring competitive pricing while maximizing revenue.

### Success Criteria

- **High Model Accuracy:** The models should accurately predict cancellations and forecast ADR, with a focus on precision and recall to minimize false positives and negatives.
- **Actionable Insights:** The results should provide clear, actionable insights that can be integrated into business processes and strategies.

## Data Understanding

### Data Collection

- **Source:** The dataset is collected from open datasets accessible from [this article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918315191).
- **Description:** The dataset includes booking details, post-stay details, reservation-specific features, and temporal features.

### Initial Data Exploration

- **Summary Statistics:** A comprehensive summary of the data, including mean, median, standard deviation, etc.
- **Data Visualization:** Visualizations such as boxplots to understand data distribution and relationships.
- **Identification of Key Features:** Initial identification of important features and potential issues, such as missing values or outliers.

### Data Description

- **Columns and Data Types:** Detailed description of each column in the dataset.
- **Missing Values Analysis:** Analysis of missing values and strategies for handling them.
- **Preliminary Observations:** Key insights from initial data exploration.

## Data Preparation

### ETL Process

- **Converting CSVs to Feather Format:** The raw data in CSV format is converted to a more efficient Feather format for faster processing.
- **Adding UUID for Reservation IDs:** Unique identifiers (UUIDs) are generated for each reservation to ensure data integrity and facilitate data management.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Summary Statistics:** Detailed statistical summary of the dataset.
- **Data Visualization:** Creating visualizations to understand data patterns and distributions.
- **Identification of Key Features:** Identifying significant features that influence cancellations and ADR.

### Baseline Models

- **Baseline Regression Model for ADR:** A Random Forest Regression model is created to provide a baseline for forecasting ADR.
- **Baseline Classification Model to Predict Cancellations:** A Random Forest Classification model is established as a baseline for predicting cancellations.

### Feature Engineering

- **Generating Temporal and Date Features:** Extracting date components such as year, month, and day to create new temporal features.
- **Calculating Occupancies:** Calculating the total occupancy by combining adults, children, and babies for each reservation.
- **Exploding Reservation Data:** Transforming reservation data to create discrete entries for each day of the reservation period.

## Modeling

### Training Models

- **Regressing ADR:** Advanced regression models, such as RandomForestRegressor, are trained to forecast ADR.
- **Predicting Cancellations:** Advanced classification models, such as RandomForestClassifier, are trained to predict reservation cancellations.

## Evaluation

### Model Performance

- **Classification Metrics:** Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to evaluate the classification model.
- **Regression Metrics:** Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Median Absolute Error (MedAE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) are used to evaluate the regression model.
- **Confusion Matrix Analysis:** Detailed analysis of the confusion matrix to understand the classification model's performance.

### Business Evaluation
